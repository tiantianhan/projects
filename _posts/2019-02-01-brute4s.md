Out of the four of us, three of us had programming backgrounds and none of us had art backgrounds. I opted to be the artist/writer to better understand the role I wanted to eventually support and work closely with. Though I was working with simple 2D pixel art assets and animations, I still learned a lot by trying to work with the mindset of an artist, and think about what an artist would be concerned with - how user-friendly is the color scheme, does the main character pop against the backgrounds of all the rooms, is the atmosphere of the environment fitting for the story, are the assets sizes small enough, does the asset import properly into the game, etc.

What I did

* Wrote game story and wrote Python scripts for streamlining the process of updating dialogue in the game with each draft of the story
* Created all pixel art sprite sheets and animations based on designer specifications and iterated artwork based on client feedback
* Collaborated with two other programmers as needed and during crunch time coding game functionality like hidden objects and end credits
