I took and thoroughly enjoyed a wonderful course in animation production pipeline that gave me an introduction and overview to how animated films are made.

I learned about how to design a character that visually complements its personality, its role in the story, and the world it belongs to. I learned to find references and make storyboards. I learned the basics of box modeling, sculpting and retopologizing, rigging, Python scripting to automate part of the rigging, animation and rendering. It really helped me begin to understand the role of a 3D artist in animation which I think is the first step to understanding how best to build software that supports their work.

Iâ€™m responsible for all aspects of the final video except for the background image and original audio files for the sound effects.
