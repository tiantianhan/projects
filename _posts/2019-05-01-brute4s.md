Out of the four of us, three of us had programming backgrounds and none of us had art backgrounds. I opted to be the artist and writer to better understand the roles I wanted to support. Though I was working with 2D pixel art assets and animations, I still learned a lot by trying to think about what an artist would be concerned with - do the colors help guide the user, is the main character visible against the backgrounds of all the rooms, is the atmosphere of the environment fitting for the story, are the assets sizes small enough, do the asset import properly into the game, and so on. Through this experience, I learned new respect for artists' needs and would definitely be able to better identify them as a programmer or techartist in the future.

What I did

* Wrote game story script
* Wrote Python scripts to streamline the process of updating dialogue in the game with each draft of the story
* Created all pixel art sprite sheets and animations based on designer specifications and iterated artwork based on client feedback
* Collaborated with two other programmers as needed and during crunch time, coding game functionality like hidden objects and end credits

Particularly proud of
* Creating a functional workflow for making pixel art while the game is being developed
* Photoshop features to preview animation and pixel art tiling
* Reiterating based on feedback for pixel art UI icons
