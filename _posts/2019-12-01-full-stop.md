"Full Stop"   
A VR tool for training young women in assertive resistance to unwanted advances. The finished tool was successfully handed off to our client, a clinical psychologist and researcher, at the end of the project.

<!-- more -->

The main challenge we faced was that the tool was intended for research and had to meet certain exact specifications, such as having a minimum number of scenes, in order to be useful. We had a limited amount of time to create the environments, so after consulting with our client, we made the choice to use 360 video rather than CG assets early in the process. We carefully followed a shooting schedule to ensure we would complete the project on time. 

I learned that projects of this type very much depended on the client's requirements, which could be unique and unexpected, and that good communication early on is absolutely key to meeting those needs.

What I did 
* Designed software architecture  
* Wrote software for managing videos and transitions
* Coordinated client communications     
* Coordinated 360 video footage shooting sessions  

Particularly proud of
* Smooth blinking transitions that minimized discontinuity between looping video clips
* Python automation for easily formatting and syncing scripts, filming paperwork and program assets
