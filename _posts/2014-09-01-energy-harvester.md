As a visiting summer student, I helped test the power output of piezoelectric energy harvesters.

The energy harvesters were intended to power sensors with energy from the vibrations of the very motors they were monitoring. I learned about circuits that maximize the power output of the harvesters, how to lay up a PCB, and how to use MATLAB code to automate experiments and take measurements.

It was incredible to learn about some of the methods that were used to maximize the energy efficiency for such devices and it was exciting to contribute to the development process.
