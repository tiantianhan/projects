For my undergrad thesis, I researched human skin color transfer algorithms and wrote a program that adjusts skin colour on images of human hands to match the color in a target image.

The motivation was a nail polish try-on app that used a model hand to demonstrate the appearance of nail polish. We wanted to be able to adjust the skin colour of the model hand to the userâ€™s exact skin colour. That way, the user would have much a better idea how the nail polish would look on themselves.

Skin colour matching and correcting is a common task for people who edit photos. The challenge was to do it automatically, and have it look natural without the help of a human making judgments based on what looks "right".

The experience gave me valuable insight into the process for formal academic writing. I learned how to perform background research in existing literature and presenting the final algorithm and results in a organized way.
