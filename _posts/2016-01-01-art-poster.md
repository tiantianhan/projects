**Platforms:** Photoshop  

I volunteered making promotional materials for a community theatre in Toronto, and made this poster for a production of Foxfinder.

The play is about the happenings at a farmhouse in a dystopian society where every problem is blamed on the elusive foxes… yet nobody even remembers how they look anymore. 

The idea of blaming foxes was so interesting to me, I decided that it would really draw attention if I put a giant fox on the poster, so that the first thought to cross the wandering mind of anyone who saw it would be “fox”.
