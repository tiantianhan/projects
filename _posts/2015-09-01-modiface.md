I made Android apps for digital visualization of clothing and cosmetics.

I worked on four projects, between 1 - 6 months each, individually or in small teams, some with in-house designers, and some for clients.

This was my first experience with software development in production. Beyond technical skills, I also learned about the process for publishing apps and continuing to provide technical support and updates.

What I did:
* Write Android apps, I worked on both user interfaces and the image processing backend
* Make use of in-house library functions, modify or add to functions when necessary
* Research for the core technology in novel computer vision and visual tracking applications
* Port applications from iOS to Android,  rewriting the application while consulting Objective-C code, extracting assets
* Work with in-house designers to create UI to specifications
* Communicate with clients and make adjustments to specifications
