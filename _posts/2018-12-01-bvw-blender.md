**Entertainment Technology Center (ETC), Carnegie Mellon University**  
**Building Virtual Worlds (BVW), 2018**  

**Platforms:** Makey Makey, Oculus, Unity, C#  
**Scope:** Built in three weeks with team of five  
**My role:** Programmer

“Blender Friender”  
A two-person experience where one guest is a blender in VR and the other guest sends fruit to the blender with a control panel made from real fruit.

<!-- more -->

What I did
* Design the experience with the team
* Fruit conveyor belt script and effects
* Cup-filling and water overflow script and effects.
* Leaderboard and score saving
* Sound and art asset placement and integration
* The physical prop for the Makey Makey fruit panel, including the electrical wiring

Particularly proud of
* I had the idea to use a static wrist strap to ground the guests so they could play with two hands
* I made good use of cardboard prototypes before the final the wood prop to improve on the placement of the fruit
* I made well-timed animations for the virtual cup and fruit panel that seemed to help testers understand the game better
