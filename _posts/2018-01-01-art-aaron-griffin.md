I found an artist, Aaron Griffin, who draws portraits in a style that I really loved and decided to try to learn his process and how to use his brushes.

The reference for the drawing is a screen-capture from the T.V. show Supernatural, a moment which I thought highlighted a really important trait of the character - he is a soldier loyal to a cause.

I’ve really enjoyed learning to draw faces. The process has taught me a lot about light, shadows, textures, colours, and human anatomy. I’m know there’s more I haven’t yet fathomed. I never knew so much could go into a drawing until I tried it.
