I found an artist, [Aaron Griffin](https://www.artstation.com/aaron-griffin), who draws portraits in a style that I really liked and tried to learn his process based on demos and brushes he had kindly posted online.

I especially like Aaron Griffin's style because while he uses digital tools, his portraits have a paint and paper appearance to them. I really like projects that do this - that use digital tools but still have real-world noise and imperfections in the result.

The reference for this drawing is a screen-capture from the T.V. show Supernatural, a moment which I thought highlighted a really important trait of the character - he is a soldier loyal to a cause. The drawing process taught me a lot about light, shadows, textures, colours, and human anatomy.
