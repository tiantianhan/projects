**Platforms:** Kinect, Unity, C#  
**Scope:** Built in one week with team of four  
**My role:** Programmer

“Photoshoot from Hell”

A Kinect game where guests are fashionable skeletons, and must shake away pesky spiders and bats before posing for their photoshoot.

<!-- more -->

What I did
* Design the experience with the team
* Write the programs detecting rapid joint shaking given data from the Kinect
* Write the game state machine
* Integrate art and sound assets as needed

Particularly proud of
* Reliably detecting guest shaking movements  
* Working fast with the team
* Adding a Gremlin asset in the background speedily on artist request
* How fun this game turned out to be to play!
