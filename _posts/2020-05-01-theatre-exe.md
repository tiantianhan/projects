"Theatre.exe"   
I researched interactive theatre, trying to understand the role technology could play in enhancing an audience's sense of agency. We finished the semester by writing an [article](https://press.etc.cmu.edu/index.php/product/well-played-vol-10-no-2/) of our reflections in the ETC's Well-played Journal's issue on playable theatre.

We started with making a compilation as comprehensive as possible of relevant existing productions, from immersive theatre to promenade theatre to theme park live video games to live action role plays. Our survey gave us better understanding of the great variety of this field and served as information future researchers could build on. We then developed prototypes of our own that used platforms we were familiar with - AR Foundation, the Makey Makey, to invite audience participation in ways we hadn't seen before.

I gained valuable insight into the research process for interactive theatre. I especially appreciated meeting and working with professionals in the field who are passionate about experiences with audience participation. It was both challenging and interesting for me as a software developer to learn how to collaborate closely with writers and playwrights.
